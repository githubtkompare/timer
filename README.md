# timer

https://timer.kompare.us/

I need a simple timer for the web. The ones out there don't fit the bill.

1. The background turns blue when there is less than five minutes left.
2. The background turns violet when there is less than two minutes.
3. The background turns red when time runs out.

There are a few different time formats for ease of reading:
1. Above an hour, it will format time with an hours suffix as "h" and a minutes suffix with "m". For example: "1h 23m"
2. Below and hour, it will only show minutes. For example: "46m"
3. Below tem minutes, it will show both minutes and seconds. For example: "7:45"
4. Below one minute, it will only show seconds. For example: "25"
